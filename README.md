# Odin Recipes Project

I have been focusing so much on learning Java lately, that I'm needing to refresh my front-end skills. I'm going through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) curriculum and this is the first project. The project's purpose is to put the student's HTML knowledge into practice by building a basic recipe website.
