    <h2>Yummy Tomato Soup</h2>
    <p>Make delicious soup</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3 lbs of tomatoes</li>
        <li>4 Tbsp unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>salt, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Remove cores from tomatoes and cut in half crosswise. Reserve until needed. </li>
        <li>Heat butter and olive oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add garlic and cook until garlic is sizzling
            in the hot fat, 45 seconds to 1 minute. Carefully add tomatoes with their juices and salt. Toss with a spoon
            every few minutes until tomatoes release their liquid and start to break down. </li>
        <li>Once tomatoes have softened and started to collapse, reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring
            occasionally, until tomatoes have fallen apart and the soup resembles a coarse tomato sauce, about 45
            minutes. </li>
        <li>Remove soup from heat and pass through a mesh strainer into a bowl. Use the back of a ladle to push all the
            tomato mixture through. Discard the skins and seeds.</li>
        <li>Transfer the strained tomato soup back into the saucepan and place back over medium-low heat. Continue
            cooking to thicken slightly, if desired, or simply bring back to a simmer and serve immediately with the
            cheese toasts.</li>
    </ol>
